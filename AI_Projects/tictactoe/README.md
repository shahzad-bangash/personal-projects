# Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is an AI-powered Tic Tac Toe game player built with Python.

---

## How It Works

- The game board is like a 3x3 grid.
- You choose to play as X or O. O turn is always first.
- AI looks at all possible moves and picks the smartest one.
- Keeps playing until someone wins or the board is full.

## Is It AI?

Yes! This player uses a basic form of Artificial Intelligence (AI) called the **Minimax algorithm**. It thinks ahead by:

- Checking all possible moves,
- Predicting the results,
- Choosing the move that leads to the best outcome.

Because of this, it never loses and always plays optimally.
